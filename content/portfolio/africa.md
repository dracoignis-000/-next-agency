##### title: Africa Uncovered

Africa, a continent rich in history, culture, and resilience, celebrates Africa Day on the 25th of May each year. This significant occasion commemorates the foundation of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in 1963, now known as the African Union (AU). Africa Day is a vibrant celebration of African heritage, unity, and progress. In this blog, we delve into the historical significance of Africa Day and explore the contemporary celebrations that embrace the continent's diverse cultures and aspirations.

This project was dedicated to celebrate Africa day and includes a rich gallery of africa and its history
