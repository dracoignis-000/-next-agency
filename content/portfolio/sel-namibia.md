Social Emotional Learning (SEL), what is it, and why does it matter to educators? As an educator, some of the worst things you can hear a student say is, “This is stupid,” or “Why are we learning this?” Think back to when you were in school and the subjects that caused you the most frustration.

One of the most rewarding aspects of my role was the opportunity to work directly with children and youth. Through my counseling sessions, I was able to help them develop important social and emotional skills, such as self-awareness, empathy, and decision-making. It was inspiring to see how these skills could help children and youth navigate challenging situations and make positive changes in their lives.



##### Today, in an ever-diversifying world, the classroom is the place where students are often first exposed to people who hail from a range of different backgrounds, hold differing beliefs, and have unique capabilities. To account for these differences and help put all students on an equal footing to succeed, social and emotional learning (SEL) aims to help students better understand their thoughts and emotions, to become more self-aware, and to develop more empathy for others within their community and the world around them.

You’d likely find some common ground with your students in wishing you were given clear reasons why something was important and how learning a subject or skill would benefit you now, as well as years later. That frustration and finding constructive ways to deal with emotions and interact with one another in respectful ways are just a few of the guiding principles behind social emotional learning, or SEL.

#### Developing these qualities in the classroom can help students become better, more productive, self-aware, and socially-aware citizens outside of the classroom in the years ahead. Learn more about the importance of social emotional learning, as well as its benefits both in and out of the classroom.

As a volunteer with SEL (Social Emotional Learning), I had the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of children and youth in my community. My role involved supporting the project team with a variety of tasks, including project administration, project fieldwork support, and counseling for children and youth.



In addition to counseling, I also provided support for project administration and fieldwork. This involved tasks such as data collection, analysis, and reporting. I also helped to organize events and activities for children and youth, such as workshops, sports events, and community service projects.

My volunteer work with SEL gave me a deeper understanding of the importance of social welfare in developing countries. It showed me how investing in education, healthcare, and social services can have a profound impact on the well-being of communities. Through volunteering, I was able to contribute to these efforts and make a positive impact in the lives of those around me.

In many developing countries, social welfare systems are under-resourced and overburdened. This can leave vulnerable populations, such as children and youth, without the support they need to thrive. Volunteering with organizations like SEL can help fill these gaps, providing essential services and support to those who need it most.

Overall, my experience as a SEL volunteer was both challenging and rewarding. It taught me the value of community service and the power of human connection. I am grateful for the opportunity to have made a difference in the lives of others.
