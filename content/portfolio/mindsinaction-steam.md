Mindsinaction STEAM Centre is an organization in Namibia that aims to provide opportunities in Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics (STEAM) education to the youth. Their mission is to make STEAM education accessible and their vision is to create a generation of innovators. 

---

The organization was founded in 2017 and initially offered mobile programs to schools, but later expanded to establish a STEAM Centre in Windhoek. The centre offers modules in various areas such as robotics, coding, electronics, 3D printing, renewable energy, and more. 

Each module lasts for eight weeks and is attended once a week. Mindsinaction provides all the necessary materials and equipment for the modules. The company plans to acquire more learning equipment, expand to all 14 regions in Namibia, and expose African children to Industry 4.0 Skills through STEAM programs by 2030. 

STEAM education benefits students by promoting creative thinking, collaboration, critical thinking, problem-solving, and hands-on learning experiences. Mindsinaction emphasizes adaptive curriculum, teamwork, transitioning from technology consumers to creators, creativity, prototyping, research, project-based teaching, and fun-filled projects.
