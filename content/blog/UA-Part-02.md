The Anglo-Zulu War (1879) was a significant conflict between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom in South Africa. The British had multiple interests in Zululand, including the desire to utilize the Zulu population for labor in the diamond fields of South Africa. They also aimed to establish a South African federation that encompassed Zululand and resolve land disputes with the Boer population.

Overall, the war had significant implications for both the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom, reshaping the political landscape of the region and leaving a lasting impact on the history of South Africa.

The battle involved United States troops and Somali militiamen loyal to Somali General Mohamed Farrah Aidid. The conflict took place within the context of the Somali civil war that had been ongoing since 1991.

The Battle of Mogadishu changed the course of events in Somalia and left a lasting mark on US military and foreign policy decisions.

The Malê Rebellion, also known as The Great Revolt, took place in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, in January 1835. It was a Muslim slave rebellion led by enslaved African Muslims and freemen. The rebellion was organized by Yoruba and Hausa Muslims, but participants from various backgrounds, including non-Muslims, also joined. The uprising was named the Malê Rebellion because Muslims in Brazil were called Malê in Yoruba.

Despite the rebellion's failure, it is seen as a turning point in the history of slavery in Brazil. Following the rebellion, the slave trade that brought Africans to Brazil gradually ended, beginning in the 1850s. The "Free Womb Law" was enacted in 1871, declaring that children born to enslaved women would be free. Slavery was officially abolished in Brazil in 1888.

The blog post discusses Tacky's War, also known as Tacky's Rebellion, which took place in St. Mary Parish, Jamaica, from 1760 to 1761. The rebellion was led by Tacky, a member of the Fante ethnic group from Ghana, and involved various ethnic groups from Ghana, including the Akan, Nzema, Fanti, and Ashanti. It was one of the most significant slave rebellions in the Caribbean during the 18th century.

The blog post provides a brief overview of Tacky's War, its key events, and the ultimate outcome of the rebellion. It also references additional sources for further information on the topic.


### THE ZANZIBAR REVOLUTION OF 1964

Arab control over the Spice Islands of Zanzibar and Pemba began in 1840 when the Sultan of Oman moved his capital to Zanzibar. Over time, many Arabs from Oman and other regions of the Arabian Peninsula settled on the islands and established a trading network that extended into Africa, India, and Indonesia. While some intermarried with the local African population, others became slaveholders, exploiting the African majority.

Following the uprising, more moderate forces took control of the revolution, and Abeid Karume was appointed President of Zanzibar. Under his leadership, racially-based policies favoring Arabs were dismantled, and land reform and redistribution were implemented. Recognizing the economic challenges and small population of Zanzibar and Pemba, Karume began working towards a union with mainland Tanganyika, which was soon to gain independence. The union of Zanzibar and Tanganyika formed the nation of Tanzania on April 26, 1964.

In the early 1520s, the Spanish controlled Hispaniola and had imported African slaves after subduing the local Indian population. The rebellion's exact date is a subject of debate, with some sources suggesting it occurred on Christmas Day and others indicating December 26. The uprising took place on the Nueva Isabela sugar plantation owned by Diego Colón, the governor of the colony and son of Christopher Columbus. According to local oral tradition, the rebellion was led by Maria Olofa (Wolofa) and Gonzalo Mandinga, both belonging to the Wolof ethnic group from West Africa.

Although the revolt failed, its memory served as an inspiration for future rebellions, posing a continued challenge to Spanish rule in the Caribbean until slavery was eventually abolished in the nineteenth century.
