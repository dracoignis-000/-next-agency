A Glance at History: The roots of Africa Day trace back to the First Congress of Independent African States held in Accra, Ghana, in 1958. Prime Minister Dr. Kwame Nkrumah spearheaded the gathering, which showcased the progress of liberation movements and symbolized Africa's determination to free itself from foreign domination. This historic meeting laid the groundwork for subsequent gatherings that led to the formation of the OAU in 1963. On May 25th, 1963, representatives from thirty African nations met in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to establish the OAU and promote decolonization across the continent.

> Unveiling Africa's Richness: Africa Day provides an opportunity to celebrate the accomplishments and cultural diversity of the African continent. Festivities take place both within Africa and worldwide, encompassing various events, conferences, exhibitions, and performances. Themes are set each year, focusing on critical aspects of African development and empowerment. For instance, the theme for the 2023 Africa Day celebration is "Our Africa Our Future," highlighting the continent's potential and aspirations for a prosperous future.
