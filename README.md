### Here's a step-by-step guide to help you with the installation:

- Step 1: Check system requirements
Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that your computer meets the system requirements for Hugo. It is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- Step 2: Install Hugo
To install Hugo, you'll need to download the appropriate binary for your operating system.

For Windows:

Visit the Hugo releases page on GitHub (https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases).
Under "Assets," look for the Windows binary file with the filename ending in .exe.
Download the binary file for the latest release.
For macOS:

Visit the Hugo releases page on GitHub.
Under "Assets," look for the macOS binary file with the filename ending in .macOS-64bit.tar.gz.
Download the binary file for the latest release.
For Linux:

Visit the Hugo releases page on GitHub.
Under "Assets," look for the Linux binary file with the filename ending in .Linux-64bit.tar.gz.
Download the binary file for the latest release.

- Step 3: Extract the Hugo binary
Once the binary file is downloaded, extract it from the downloaded archive. You can use built-in tools or third-party tools like 7-Zip for this.

- Step 4: Add Hugo to the system PATH (optional)
To use Hugo from any directory in your terminal, you can add the Hugo binary to your system's PATH environment variable. This step is optional but recommended.

For Windows:

Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables."
Open the "Edit the system environment variables" option.
Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
In the "System Variables" section, find the "Path" variable and click on "Edit."
Click on "New" and enter the path to the directory where you extracted the Hugo binary.
Click "OK" to save the changes.
For macOS and Linux:

Open a terminal window.
Open your shell's configuration file. For example, for macOS, you can use nano ~/.bash_profile.
Add the following line at the end of the file, replacing /path/to/hugo with the actual path to the directory where you extracted the Hugo binary:
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/hugo
Save the file and exit the editor.
Run the command source ~/.bash_profile (or source ~/.bashrc for Linux) to reload the configuration.
Step 5: Verify the installation
To verify that Hugo is installed correctly, open a new terminal window and run the following command:

Copy code
hugo version
If everything was set up correctly, it should display the installed Hugo version.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Hugo on your computer. Now you can start using it to create and build your websites using Hugo templates. Remember to refer to Hugo's official documentation (https://gohugo.io/documentation/) for further guidance on creating and customizing your sites.

Note: This guide assumes that you have some familiarity with the command line and basic web development concepts.
